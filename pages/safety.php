                <li>Meeting Safely
                    <p>When meeting someone from Baobab to complete a transaction, your safety should always be the top priority. Follow these essential guidelines to protect yourself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Meet in public places:</strong> Choose busy, well-lit locations like shopping centers, coffee shops, or designated safe exchange zones</li>
                        <li><strong>Bring a friend when possible:</strong> Having someone accompany you provides an extra layer of security and peace of mind</li>
                        <li><strong>Inform others:</strong> Always let someone know where you're going, who you're meeting, and when you expect to return</li>
                        <li><strong>Meet during daylight hours:</strong> Avoid late night or early morning meetings when possible</li>
                        <li><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> If something feels off about the meeting location or person, don't proceed</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Item Inspection
                    <p>Thoroughly examining items before completing your purchase helps ensure you get exactly what you expect and avoid potential issues:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inspect items thoroughly:</strong> Check for damage, wear, functionality, and authenticity before agreeing to purchase</li>
                        <li><strong>Test electronic items:</strong> Ensure devices power on, charge properly, and all features work as described</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify authenticity:</strong> Look for genuine brand markings, serial numbers, and other authentication features</li>
                        <li><strong>Check measurements:</strong> Confirm dimensions, sizes, and specifications match the listing description</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask questions:</strong> Don't hesitate to inquire about any concerns or request additional information</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Secure Payment Methods
                    <p>Using secure payment methods protects both buyers and sellers from fraud and provides recourse if issues arise:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use our platform's payment system:</strong> Baobab's secure payment system offers protection and dispute resolution</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid cash transactions:</strong> While convenient, cash offers no protection if problems occur</li>
                        <li><strong>Never wire money:</strong> Wire transfers are irreversible and commonly used in scams</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid cryptocurrency payments:</strong> These are difficult to trace and recover if issues arise</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep payment records:</strong> Save receipts, confirmation emails, and transaction details</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Seller Verification
                    <p>Taking time to verify the seller's credibility can help you avoid scams and ensure a positive transaction experience:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Check seller ratings and reviews:</strong> Look for consistent positive feedback and recent activity</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify seller identity:</strong> Ensure the seller's profile appears genuine and complete</li>
                        <li><strong>Review listing history:</strong> Check if the seller has successfully completed similar transactions</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask for additional photos:</strong> Request specific angles or details to verify the item's condition</li>
                        <li><strong>Communicate through the platform:</strong> Keep all communication within Baobab's messaging system</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Protecting Personal Information
                    <p>Safeguarding your personal and financial information is crucial to preventing identity theft and fraud:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Never share personal financial information:</strong> Don't provide bank account details, credit card numbers, or passwords</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect your address:</strong> Avoid sharing your home address until you're confident in the transaction</li>
                        <li><strong>Be cautious with phone numbers:</strong> Consider using Baobab's messaging system instead of sharing personal contact information</li>
                        <li><strong>Guard your social media:</strong> Be mindful of what personal information is visible on your social profiles</li>
                        <li><strong>Use strong passwords:</strong> Protect your Baobab account with a unique, secure password</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Recognizing Red Flags
                    <p>Being aware of common warning signs can help you identify and avoid potential scams or dangerous situations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>If it seems too good to be true, it probably is:</strong> Extremely low prices or amazing deals often indicate scams</li>
                        <li><strong>Pressure to act quickly:</strong> Legitimate sellers don't rush buyers into immediate decisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Requests for unusual payment methods:</strong> Be wary of sellers who insist on wire transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrency</li>
                        <li><strong>Poor communication:</strong> Sellers who avoid questions, provide vague answers, or have poor grammar may be suspicious</li>
                        <li><strong>Reluctance to meet in person:</strong> Avoid sellers who refuse to meet publicly or insist on shipping only</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Emergency Procedures
                    <p>Know what to do if you encounter a dangerous situation or become a victim of fraud:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> If you feel unsafe at any point, leave the situation immediately</li>
                        <li><strong>Report suspicious activity:</strong> Use Baobab's reporting system to flag concerning behavior</li>
