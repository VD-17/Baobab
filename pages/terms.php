                <li>Introduction
                    <p>Welcome to Baobab, a C2C marketplace designed specifically for South Africans. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Baobab platform, including any associated mobile applications, websites, and services.</p>
                </li>
                <li>User Accounts
                    <p>To use certain features of our Service, you must register for an account. When you register, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself. You are responsible for safeguarding your account password and for any activities or actions under your account. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. Baobab reserves the right to disable any user account if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Listing and Selling
                    <p>As a seller on Baobab, you are responsible for ensuring that your listings comply with all applicable laws and regulations in South Africa. This includes accurately describing the condition, features, and any defects of the items you list. You must have the legal right to sell any item you list on our platform. Items that are prohibited by law, stolen, or infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others may not be listed. Baobab reserves the right to remove any listing that violates these Terms or for any other reason at our sole discretion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Buying
                    <p>When you agree to purchase an item on Baobab, you are entering into a legally binding agreement with the seller, not with Baobab. We are merely facilitating the transaction between buyers and sellers. Buyers are expected to communicate clearly with sellers, follow through with agreed-upon transactions, and make payments promptly through our approved payment methods.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Fees and Payments
                    <p>Baobab may charge fees for certain services, such as listing items or promoting listings. These fees will be clearly communicated before you use such services. All payments on our platform are processed through our secure payment system. Baobab does not store credit card information. For transactions using our escrow service, funds will be released to the seller only after the buyer confirms receipt of the item in the condition described.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Prohibited Activities
                    <ul>
                        <li>Posting false, inaccurate, misleading, defamatory, or libelous content</li>
                        <li>Engaging in fraud, impersonation, or deceptive practices</li>
                        <li>Harassing, abusing, or threatening other users</li>
                        <li>Selling counterfeit or unauthorized replicas of products</li>
                        <li>Selling illegal, stolen, or prohibited items</li>
                        <li>Attempting to circumvent our fee structure or payment system</li>
                        <li>Using our Service to promote external websites or services</li>
                        <li>Collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information from the Service</li>
                        <li>Interfering with or disrupting the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Intellectual Property
                    <p>The Baobab name, logo, and all related names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of Baobab or its affiliates. You may not use such marks without our prior written permission. All content on our Service, including text, graphics, logos, icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, and data compilations, is the property of Baobab or its content suppliers and is protected by South African and international copyright laws.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Limitation of Liability
                    <p>Baobab shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of or inability to use the Service. While we strive to ensure the security and integrity of transactions on our platform, we cannot guarantee that all users will act honestly and in good faith. Users engage in transactions at their own risk.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Dispute Resolution
                    <p>In the event of any dispute between users, Baobab encourages you to try to resolve the matter directly with the other party through our messaging system. If you cannot resolve the dispute directly, you may contact our customer support team, who will try to help mediate the dispute. For disputes involving payments made through our escrow service, Baobab may investigate and make a determination based on our policies and the evidence provided by both parties.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Modifications to the Service and Terms
                    <p>Baobab reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. We may revise these Terms from time to time. The most current version will always be posted on our website. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Governing Law
                    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of South Africa, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of South Africa.</p>
